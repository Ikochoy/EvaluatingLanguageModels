# Evaluating Language Models

The task for the project is to do the following tasks:
- Task 1: Leverage the MultiNLI dataset, and explore how the models (GPT2, Flan-T5) perform when they have to predict whether the hypothesis is entailed, contradicted or remain neutral with premise
- Task 2: Evaluate the biases, stereotypes, and associations in Masked LMs (BERT, Roberta-Large) in relation to social group
